    <p>
      When I'm not building software or analysing data, you'll find me chasing adventure and embracing the outdoors.
      I'm drawn to experiences that challenge me physically and mentally—whether that's scaling rock faces,
      carving through fresh powder, or exploring new cultures. These pursuits fuel my creativity and problem-solving
      mindset, reminding me that the best solutions often come from stepping outside your comfort zone.

        <h3>Rock Climbing & Bouldering</h3>
        <p>
          There's something uniquely satisfying about solving a climbing route—analysing the problem, testing different
          approaches, and finally executing the perfect sequence. Bouldering has taught me persistence, strategic thinking,
          and the value of learning from failed attempts. Every route is a puzzle waiting to be solved.

        <h3>Mountains & Snow</h3>
        <p>
          Mountains hold a special place in my heart. Whether I'm hiking through alpine trails or enjoying winter sports,
          there's an undeniable peace and sense of wonder that comes from being surrounded by snow-capped peaks.
          Throw in a campfire with good company and you'll have me entranced in the warmth.

        <h3>Japan!</h3>
        <p>
          I sincerely recommend Japan to anyone seeking inspiration. Japan beautifully blends ancient tradition with cutting-edge innovation. The attention to detail,
          respect for craftsmanship, and culture of continuous improvement deeply resonate with my approach to software
          engineering. Plus, the food is incredible, just be wary of your bank account with all the knick-knack purchases.

        <h3>Games</h3>
        <p>
          From boardgames, to mafia and online games, I have always enjoyed a sense of competition and strategy since I was young.
          I love to host things and perform as the host! and consistently get told to start doing D & D sessions.
