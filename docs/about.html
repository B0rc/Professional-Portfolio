    <p>
      When I'm not building software or analysing data, you'll find me chasing adventure and embracing life's diverse experiences.
      From the spooky charm of Halloween to the serene peaks of snow-capped mountains, from competitive board games to exploring
      distant cultures—these passions fuel my creativity and resilience. Every challenge, whether on a climbing wall or in the
      remote desert, shapes who I am as an engineer and problem-solver.

        <h3>Hobbies & Passions</h3>
        <p>
          I'm drawn to the mysterious and spooky—Halloween is my favorite time of year, and The Nightmare Before Christmas
          never gets old. I love the strategic depth of board games, the intensity of Mafia, and the thrill of video games.
          I'm always the one organizing game nights and hosting events—friends keep telling me I should run D&D sessions!
          Staying active through running and bouldering keeps me sharp, both mentally and physically.

        <h3>Mountains & Snow</h3>
        <p>
          Mountains hold a special place in my heart. There's something magical about being surrounded by snow-capped peaks—
          whether I'm hiking alpine trails, enjoying winter sports, or simply taking in the breathtaking views. The crisp
          mountain air, the peaceful silence of snowfall, and the raw beauty of nature remind me why stepping outside your
          comfort zone leads to the greatest rewards.

        <h3>Japan - A Place That Inspired Me</h3>
        <p>
          I sincerely recommend Japan to anyone seeking inspiration. The country beautifully blends ancient tradition with
          cutting-edge innovation. The meticulous attention to detail, deep respect for craftsmanship, and culture of continuous
          improvement resonate strongly with my approach to software engineering. Plus, the food is incredible—just be wary of
          your bank account with all those irresistible knick-knack purchases!

        <h3>Where It All Began - The Desert</h3>
        <p>
          This is where my journey truly started—working in the remote Pilbara desert at Rio Tinto. The harsh, unforgiving
          environment built my resilience and work ethic. Long days in extreme conditions, managing complex operations, and
          solving problems with limited resources taught me adaptability and determination. These five years in the desert
          forged the foundation of who I am today—someone who thrives under pressure and never backs down from a challenge.

      <h2>How It Connects</h2>
      <p>
        Every experience shapes my approach to engineering. Strategic games teach me to think several moves ahead. Mountains
        remind me that the hardest climbs offer the best views. Japan showed me the value of craftsmanship and continuous
        improvement. The desert taught me resilience when conditions are tough. Each passion fuels my curiosity and drives
        me to keep learning, exploring, and growing—both in code and in life.
      </p>
      <p class="philosophy-highlight">
        "From the desert's harsh lessons to mountaintop victories, from strategic game nights to cultural discoveries—
        these experiences don't just define my hobbies, they define my approach to problem-solving and engineering excellence."
